          7 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go
          and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the
          Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall
          prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he
          commandeth them.
